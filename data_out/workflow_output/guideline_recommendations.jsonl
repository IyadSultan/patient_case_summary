{"guideline_source":"Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma","recommendation_summary":"For children with persistent asthma, daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as the preferred controller therapy. Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) should be used as needed for quick relief of symptoms. If symptoms are not adequately controlled, consider stepping up the treatment. Increasing use of SABA or use more than two days a week for symptom relief indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment.","reference_section":"2020 FOCUSED UPDATES TO THE Asthma Management Guidelines, p. 27"}
