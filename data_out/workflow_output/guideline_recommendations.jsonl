{"guideline_source":"NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025","recommendation_summary":"For patients with desmoplastic melanoma, particularly those with pure desmoplastic melanoma (â‰¥90% stromal fibrosis), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) positivity is less common. The role of SLNB in these patients remains controversial due to variability in SLNB positivity rates across studies. Pathology reporting of neurotropism may guide clinical decision-making, such as further excision or adjuvant radiation therapy. Adjuvant radiation therapy may be considered to improve local control in desmoplastic melanoma cases.","reference_section":"ME-1A, ME-E"}
